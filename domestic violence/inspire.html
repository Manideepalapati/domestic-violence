            And that paid off as she cleared the Kerala Police Special Recruitment in 2021.
            
            She joined as a civil police officer on April 15, 2021.</P>

            </u>
     <p class="lead mb-4 display-7" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif,!important" >
        Pooja suffered abuse and violence at the hands of her husband and his family. Her fault: giving birth to a girl child. Her husband wanted a son. Fearing for the life of the girl child, Pooja’s parents came and took the child with them.

        Three years later she gave birth to a boy. She hoped this would appease her husband. However, her husband now had a new reason to abuse her. He started demanding for dowry. Five years into marriage, Pooja was completely controlled by her husband. At his whims and fancy, he would drop Pooja and children at her parents and would not take them home for months.
        
        While Pooja lived with her parents she came in contact with Maitri’s community project and joined the women’s group (Mahila Panchayat). This helped her come out of the isolation and interact with other women. She then opened up about her situation. When her husband came to pick her up again, Maitri stood with Pooja and got written consent from him and his family declaring that they will be responsible if any harm is caused to her. However, after some months of returning to with her husband he again turned violent and Pooja fled to her parent’s house.
        
        Maitri helped her approach the Delhi Commission for Women. Pooja and her husband were counseled and her husband was given clear warning about violence and reminded of his responsibility as a husband and a father. This was a turning point for Pooja. Recently, Maitri did another follow up call with Pooja and found that she is doing well. Her husband has stopped being violent. He has even got a job and is able to take care of his family. All this was possible because Pooja was empowered and supported to say no to violence.

     <p class="lead mb-4 display-7" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif,!important" >
        I walked out of an abusive marriage with two children and I never looked back. Today, I help trauma survivors and abuse victims rewrite their stories.

        Stuck in an abusive marriage, I often wondered, “Why is this happening to me?”
        I lived without an understanding of what was happening for the longest time until the day I chose to walk out with my children.
        
        It was my darkest hour. I did not know what the future had in store for me. I was stepping from nothing into nothing, with only conviction to guide me. It was a tough decision. It was like deciding between life and death; deciding between breath and no breath.
        
        Two years later, I stumbled upon Sakshi, a rights-based NGO where I now work as an executive director. At the time, I was going through a lot; my sense of self was not intact.
        
        But this was my turning point.
        
        When I began working with third-degree domestic violence survivors at the NGO, I decided to employ theatre, which I consider to be one of the most non-threatening ways of processing traumatic incidents.
        
        Having written plays since Class 6, I was always fascinated by how theatre makes one feel safe and allows one to “be” another.
        
        I wanted to create a safe space for other abuse survivors like me. I knew theatre would allow them to look at the past objectively and understand their choices in hindsight.
        
        Theatre is non-threatening, and yet, it is cathartic. Here, these women are allowed to shed their baggage of darkness and brutality. It allows them to take a step into their own agency. It enables them to take charge of rewriting their story.
        
        Women are often compelled to stay in abusive relationships because walking out is scary. Society glorifies their martyrdom.
        
        Patterns begin to feel safe while breaking them seems scary. I intended to help them change these narratives.
        
        I want to create an environment where people are cherished and celebrated. I want to make this dream a reality for many.
        
        What are the stories these women will write about their lives? I don’t know. I am also struggling while I continue to rewrite my own story.
